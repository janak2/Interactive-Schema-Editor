Hardware: 
All you need is a computer and mouse. System could also be used on a tablet and stylus. 

Software: 
To see the system in action all you need to do is run "app.py"

Make sure to install requirements.txt

The system runs best on Windows, but also runs on Mac OS but make sure to install all the packages needed. 

app.py will call on:
- gui.py which is how the tkinter app is running
- main.py which calls on detector.py where all the text, colour, and sketch recognition is happening.
